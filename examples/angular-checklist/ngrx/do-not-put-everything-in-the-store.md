title: don't put everything in the store
---

# Problem

`@ngrx/store` (or Redux in general) provides us with a lot of great features and can be used in a lot of use cases. But sometimes this pattern can be an overkill. Implementing it means we get the downside of using Redux (a lot of extra code and complexity) without benefiting of the upsides (predictable state container and unidirectional data flow).

# Solution

The NgRx core team has come up with a principle called **SHARI**, that can be used as a rule of thumb on data that needs to be added to the store.

- Shared: State that is shared between many components and services
- Hydrated: State that needs to be persisted and hydrated across page reloads
- Available: State that needs to be available when re-entering routes
- Retrieved: State that needs to be retrieved with a side effect, e.g. an HTTP request
- Impacted: State that is impacted by other components

Try not to over-engineer your state management layer. Data is often fetched via XHR requests or is being sent over a WebSocket, and therefore is handled on the server side. Always ask yourself **when** and **why** to put some data in a client side store and keep alternatives in mind. For example, use routes to reflect applied filters on a list or use a `BehaviorSubject` in a service if you need to store some simple data, such as settings.
